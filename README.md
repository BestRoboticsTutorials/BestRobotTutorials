# Best Robot Tutorials
==================

This is a sample of code written for the ArmV7 Cortex V2 Robot Processor. The code written here has been either used for robotics competition setup or taught and reproduced from scratch by students from grades 6-12. The code here has been written for the competition called B.E.S.T.

B.oosting
E.ngineering
S.cience and
T.echnology

The code here is a derivative of CPP code with a few variations. For the sake of simplicity for my 6th graders, I have chosen to leave out the teaching of headers, Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, Namespaces, etc. As well as leaving out the allowed element of multiple files and classes. I did however dive into functions and their usefulness to such students. 

The goal of the competition is to have a middle or high school team take raw plywood, pvc, attachment hardware (screws, bolts, cement) and the provided electronics and to build and program the robot from scratch with only instruction and no physical help in the timespan of 6 weeks from finding out the game to the day that they compete. 

To Teams who stumble across this code on the internet, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY AND PASTE THIS FOR COMPETITION!!! You may use the code to test your hardware, you may use the code as an example on how to program and use it to your advantage, HOWEVER code is supposed to be taught and then written by students, NOT COPIED DOWN. Even rewriting the code on this site word for word will be counted as illegal in competitions and against the rules of the game.
